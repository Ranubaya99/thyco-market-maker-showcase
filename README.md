# Tycho Market Maker Showcase

This project demonstrates a simple market maker built using the Tycho framework.  
The market maker continuously monitors prices and inventory, calculates optimal trades, and executes them to keep prices within a target range.

It aims to help trading teams bring their liquidity and volume on-chain by showcasing how to integrate with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) effectively.

## Features
- Price and inventory monitoring
- Automated trade calculation and execution
- Integration guidance for working with DEXs
- Showcase of Tycho's capabilities in building market making strategies

## Getting Started
Instructions to set up, run, and test the market maker will be added soon.
